# i3-Conf
My personal i3 dot files. Well if you still haven't figured out why this exists: I will collapse my desktop one day or the other.
This is to rollback from that bad day.

## Vim:
- Contains powerline
- Contains a few snips
- A dracula theme installed via vundle (ig!)

## Termite:
- Finally figured out the right font size
- Termite usually run zsh, with ohmyzsh. Favi theme is agnoster always XD.
- Color scheme is finally sorted out.
- Other tips on termite : Use neofetch

## i3 main config:
- Contains all the keybinding that you usually use.
- Ah! The lovely status bar color scheme (Ain't lovely anol, still...)
- ``` light ``` is used to set brightness on keys.
- i3-status conf the addicted order of status bar stuff. (Change to polybar whenever possible)

## Picom :
- The compositor. The best one out there. Good for fading windows.

## Pactl-volume.sh :
- This script is useful to change the sink of your audio.

Ig, that's basically enough for me to have a stable desktop. Hope this day never comes.
